# ynab-hide-menu

I use [Ynab](https://ynab.com) as my budgeting tool and I love it.
My only issue with it is that I cannot hide the side menu's when I need to.
This is especially frustrating when I stack two browser windows side by side,
Ynab on one side, and my bank's website on the other. The sidebar does not let me navigate
properly and I endup having to zoom out the page. This extension adds a toggle functionality
to the Ynab sidebar
